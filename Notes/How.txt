How remove ‘$’ from your data in Python

Most straightforward but slowest:
%timeit df.state_bottle_retail.apply(lambda x: x.replace('$',''))

Using .strip instead of .replace, instead of replacing the ‘$’ with a blank space, it just takes out the ‘$.’:
%timeit df.state_bottle_retail.apply(lambda x: x.strip('$'))

List comprehensions: very efficient method of iterating over a lot of objects in Python. 
.strip method with a list comprehension instead of .apply method: 
%timeit [x.strip('$') for x in df.state_bottle_retail]


Slicing method (Fastest but not as safe): Instead of using a function to pull out the ‘$’, use Python built in [] slicing:
%timeit [x[1:] for x in df.state_bottle_retail]

To make any of these changes actually work, you’d have to assign the changed values back to the column you are changing in your DataFrame:
df.state_bottle_retail = [x.strip('$') for x in df.state_bottle_retail]
